# Transparency-Odyssey-IV

A text patch for Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan, which alters text on skills, items, etc. in order to inform the player of important numbers and mechanics such as damage modifiers or the importance of certain player stats.

Done:
 - All Player Skills text
 - Item text
 - Shop equipment fixes
 - Shop equipment texts
 - Guild Food Effects text

ToDo:
 - explain diminishing returns somewhere???
 - comb through and make sure all terminology is consistent through the game (and across other games???)
